                    This game demonstrates familiarity with CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript. The menu 
                    at the top of the page is built as an unordered list and animated using CSS. The 
                    @media section causes the default, CSS-only hamburger menu to give way to a 
                    standard horizontal menu.
                <p class="with-space"> The lightning bolt is animated using @keyframes and limited to 40 cycles so as 
                    to not be too distracting to the player. It sits in flex container along with the 
                    game title and running score. The running score is a global variable that is also saved to local 
                    storage.
                </p>
                <p class="with-space">
                    The text within the question button is modified by JavaScript but animated using CSS. The JavaScript 
                    code uses setTimeout() with different values to generate the countdown effect. Once the last timeout 
                    expires, JavaScript builds the HTML for the radio group within a locally-processed form. Interaction 
                    with the form is enhanced by CSS animation effects. An HTML5 canvas sits on top of the form, 
                    providing feedback to the player as a CSS transition causes the form to fade behind it.

                    Questions come from a web service and are delivered in JSON format. After parsing, the difficulty 
                    field is used to set the value of the question. The correct answer is added to the array containing 
                    incorrect answers and a JavaScript function shuffles the array before using it to build the form.
                </p>

                Start a session by pressing the "Show a Question" button. You'll be shown
                the category and the value of the question. Harder questions are worth more.
                After the countdown, you'll see the question and possible answers. The sooner 
                you answer, the more points you'll get if you are right. Be careful, though, 
                because you will also lose more points if you guess wrong. Answer as many 
                questions as you want and come back any time. Your running score is saved even 
                if you quit the browser (as long as you aren't in private mode). Have fun!
